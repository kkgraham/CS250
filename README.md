1. User Stories are a way that a team can create specific requests with details based on the needs of the
stakeholders. Using stories also allows the team to look at specific requests, rank them in priority and challenge,
and determine which tasks can be done during each sprint. The details give the team specific points of completion to
determine when the task is finsihed.

2. Developing programs includes looking at these user stories and putting them together into a working application
that pleases the clients and customers. Working on an agile team makes this process easy and uncomplicated by using
smaller sprints to complete tasks, daily communication, and other events to ensure the team is continuously on track.
This also includes being adaptable to quickly changing requirements from stakeholders. All these will be incorporated
into my practices moving forward.

3. Being a good team member means listening to team mates, sharing when I am struggling, and celebrating success in the
team. Challenging tasks will also occur, but by working together on difficult aspects can ensure those challenge are not
impossible.
